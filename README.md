# EABM.jl: The Elastically-Articulated Body Method for Modelling Fluid-Filament Interaction
### Purpose
This is a structural dynamics library for Julia. It can be used to **simulate 3D, tree-toplogy assemblies of slender structures, under the loads of a submerging fluid**. Particularly, its use is expected for simulating the dynamics of complex (branching) aquatic plants, but it has been developed with sufficient generality that it can be used in other applications. The backbone of the EABM is Roy Featherstone's *Articulated Body Algorithm*, which is sufficiently extensible such that it may take little work to introduce new forces (even beyond fluid-driven ones), closed topologies (allowing trusses, etc), or alternate boundary conditions.
### Journal Paper
This codebase is an open source version of the one used in a paper, which is currently under review, for the *Journal of Fluids and Structures*, coauthored by myself (Rufus Dickinson), Dr. Tim Marjoribanks, Prof. Chris Keylock, and Dr. Alessandro Palmeri, as part of my PhD in Fluid-Structure Interaction at Loughborough University. In that paper, **the EABM is validated in its ability to simulate linear statics and dynamics of beams, flow-induced reconfiguration of heterogeneous and complex plants, and wave-induced dynamics of seagrass**. The test cases for the module correspond to a subset of these validations.
### Technical Overview
The extension/modification of Featherstone's algorithm to the study of fluid-filament interaction is achieved through 3 principle model components: The definition of **elastic torques driving rotational joints**, simulating bending. The definition of **a suite of fluid forces; buoyancy, drag, friction, virtual buoyancy, and added mass**. Use of eigenvector analysis, iterative methods, and integrators; to respectively predict (simulate) linear dynamics, static responses, and nonlinear dynamics. Amongst some novelties of how the EABM treats these topics, the stand-out is the *virtual fluid articulation* concept, which is a neat introduction of the added mass effect to the framework of the articulated body algorithm.

Stuff from Julia library setup. I may one day submit the EABM to be an official library!
